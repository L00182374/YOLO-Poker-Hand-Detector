# YOLO-Poker-Hand-Detector
A poker hand detector I made for my computer vision module in final year, I created it to detect the current hand of players in a poker game using computer vision.
--- 
I used ultralytics to streamline model training etc. The YOLO model I used was YOLOv8n, I then trained that model on an annotated dataset of 20000 images of poker cards using my RTX 2080 for 10 epochs and then again for another 20 epochs.
